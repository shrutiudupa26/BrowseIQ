The modular design of these contracts allows operators to create generic instruments with customizable risk and fee models.\nTo Deploy\nIn order to deploy Dexterity, you will need to modify the mock keys in\nmaster_program_config.json\nto match the target program IDs. The build script will automatically fill in the keys into the program files.\nIf you would like to use the\ndeploy_all.sh\nscript. Paste the upgrade authority keypair for each of these contracts into the file\n~/.config/solana/dexterity_shared.json\n. Be sure to not commit this file.\nBuild and Run Tests\nRequirements:\nrust nightly\nsolana clis\n[Optional] solana-test-validator\nFirst, install poetry for the python client (only needed the first time around):\ncd\nclient\npoetry install\nThen build and test the protocol\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n./build.sh\n./test.sh\nNote that if you use the\n--replace\noption in the\nbuild.sh\nscript, you will need to explicitly call\ncargo build-bpf\nin the root directory to seed the target folder with program keypair files.\nAbout\nReference implementation of a decentralized exchange for custom instruments, risk, and fees\nResources\nReadme\nLicense\nApache-2.0 license\nUh oh!\nThere was an error while loading.\nPlease reload this page\n.\nActivity\nCustom properties\nStars\n79\nstars\nWatchers\n6\nwatching\nForks\n33\nforks\nReport repository\nReleases\nNo releases published\nPackages\n0\nNo packages published\nUh oh!\nThere was an error while loading.\nPlease reload this page\n.\nContributors\n2\nUh oh!\nThere was an error while loading.\nPlease reload this page\n.\nLanguages\nRust\n61.2%\nPython\n38.0%\nShell\n0.8%\nFooter\n\u00a9 2025 GitHub,\u00a0Inc.\nFooter navigation\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact\nManage cookies\nDo not share my personal information\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time."

Then Police Found Their Google Searches\nAn arson attack in Colorado had detectives stumped. The way they solved the case could put everyone at risk.\nNeil Baker (right) with partner Ernest Sandoval, who was working his first homicide case at the Denver Police Department.\nPhotography: Jimena Peck\nSave this story\nSave\nSave this story\nSave\nAmadou Sow woke\nto the shrieking of smoke detectors. It was a little after 2:30 am on August 5, 2020, and his house in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, was ablaze. The 46-year-old rushed to his bedroom door, but a column of smoke and heat forced him back. Panicked, Sow ran to the rear window, broke the screen with his hand, and jumped. The two-story drop fractured his left foot.\nSow\u2019s wife Hawa Ka woke their daughter Adama, who shared their room. She dragged the terrified 10-year-old to the window and pushed her out. Sow tried to catch her but missed. Miraculously, the girl landed on her hands and feet, uninjured. Then it was Ka\u2019s turn. When she leaped, she fell on her back, shattering her spine in two places. Sow barely heard her howls of pain. He was thinking about their 22-year-old son, Oumar.\nHe couldn\u2019t see any movement inside Oumar\u2019s room. He hurled a rock at the window, but the glass held steady. Despair filled him. Then he noticed Oumar\u2019s car wasn\u2019t in the driveway. He must be working his night shift at 7-Eleven. Thank God! Sow\u2019s family was safe. But what about the others in the house? All told, nine people called 5312 Truckee Street home.\nSow had bought the four-bedroom property in the northeastern suburb of Green Valley Ranch in 2018. The neighborhood was newly built and sparsely populated, cut off from the bulk of the city by miles of prairie grass, giving it an isolated, ghost-town feel. But for Sow, a Senegalese immigrant who usually worked nights at Walmart, the home was a refuge. Not long after his family moved in, his old friend Djibril Diol\u2019s family joined them. Diol\u2014Djiby to his friends\u2014was 29 and a towering 6'8\", a civil engineer who hoped to one day take his skills back to Senegal.\nThe first fire truck arrived at 2:47 am. By then, the inferno had shattered the windows and plumed the air with smoke. The stench of burning wood filled the neighborhood. When firefighters subdued the blaze enough to get in the front door, they found the small body of a child. Djiby\u2019s daughter Khadija had been two months shy of her second birthday. Farther in sprawled Djiby himself and his 23-year-old wife, Adja.\nNext to Adja lay Djiby\u2019s 25-year-old sister, Hassan. She\u2019d only been living in the house for three months. Like Adja, she had dreamed of going back to school to study nursing. She died with her arms still wrapped around her 7-month-old daughter, Hawa Beye. Medical examiners would later conclude that all five died of smoke inhalation, airways coated in black soot, internal organs and muscles burnished \u201ccherry-red\u201d from the heat.\nAt the same time firefighters were entering the house on Truckee Street, Neil Baker, a homicide detective for the Denver Police Department (DPD), was awoken by a call from his sergeant. Baker\u2014in his fifties with reading glasses, thinning hair, and a rosy complexion\u2014threw on a suit, muttered a hurried goodbye to his wife, and jumped in his car.\nNeil Baker and his police colleagues used Google to help solve the case.\nPhotography: Jimena Peck\nAfter nearly 30 years as a Denver-area cop, Baker knew his way around town. He also knew that Green Valley Ranch was a confusing rabbit\u2019s warren of nearly identical roads. So before he set off, he did something innocuous, something anyone might have done: He Googled the address. And like anyone who Googles something, he was thinking about the search result he wanted\u2014not the packets of data flitting between his device and\nGoogle\n\u2019s servers, not the automated logs of what he was searching for and where he was searching from. But this unseen infrastructure would be key to figuring out what happened at Truckee Street\u2014and it may soon extend the reach of law enforcement into the private lives of millions.\nThree weeks before\nthe fire, 16-year-old Kevin Bui went into central Denver to buy a gun. Bui had led a charmed life. His family emigrated from Vietnam before he was born, and though they struggled financially at first\u2014Bui describes his childhood homes as \u201cthe projects\u201d\u2014by the time he started high school, his dad\u2019s accounting business had taken off. The family moved to a palatial house in Lakewood, on Denver\u2019s western outskirts, complete with views of the mountains. Bui took to wearing Gucci belts and Air Jordans.\nRogue Nation\nWIRED profiles\nthe people who make trouble\u2014scams, drug deals, even murder\u2014and also, occasionally, save the day.\n\u201cI disliked school, but I was always really good at it,\u201d Bui tells me. He was athletic too\u2014a swimmer, and an inside linebacker on his school football team, the Green Mountain Rams. He was close with his older sister, Tanya, despite their seven-year age difference. Tanya filled Kevin\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s lashes and bitched to him about her boyfriends. The siblings discussed adopting a dog together.\nBut there was a darker side to their life: Kevin and Tanya dealt fentanyl and marijuana, often finding customers on Snapchat. Kevin planned to start \u201ccarding,\u201d stealing people\u2019s credit card information on the dark web. And he took to amassing weapons.\nThe guys Bui had arranged to meet in central Denver on that day in July had promised to sell him a gun. Instead, they robbed him of his cash,\niPhone\n, and shoes.\nAfterward, Bui bubbled with humiliation. A few weeks earlier, football practice had shut down because of the pandemic. Classes had already been virtual for months. He felt he was \u201cjust doing bullshit\u201d: waking up, logging on to Zoom, and returning to bed. The robbery tipped him over the edge. That night, at home in Lakewood, Bui resolved to get even. He pulled up the Find My device feature on his iPad and watched as it pinged his phone. The map zoomed east, past downtown, finally halting at Green Valley Ranch. A pin dropped at 5312 Truckee Street.\nThe next afternoon, Bui sent a Snapchat message to his friend Gavin Seymour. \u201cI deserved that shit cuz I knew it would happen and still went,\u201d he wrote, according to later court records. \u201cThey goin get theirs like I got mine.\u201d\nBui and Seymour ran track together and lived just a four-minute drive apart. But in many ways they were opposites. Where Bui oozed confidence, Seymour was plagued by insecurity. Where Bui excelled academically, Seymour struggled with multiple learning disabilities. In contrast to Bui\u2019s apparently cookie-cutter-perfect family life, Seymour\u2019s parents split when he was young, and his father was largely absent.\nIn response to Bui\u2019s message, Seymour wrote: \u201cidk why I would let you go alone I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d\nBui wrote back: \u201cI cant even be mad cuz we used to do the same shit to random niggas.\u201d\nBut he\nwas\nmad. More to the point, he was disgraced, his self-image\u2014as a winner, a champ, top dog\u2014shattered. A week later, Bui searched the Truckee Street address 13 times, including on sites like Zillow that detailed its interior layout. And he persuaded Seymour, who was just about to turn 16, and another friend, 14-year-old Dillon Siebert, to help him exact revenge. In late July, Seymour and Siebert also searched the address multiple times.\nBui would later insist they\u2019d planned to simply vandalize the house: hurl rocks at the windows, maybe, or egg the exterior. But sometime in those last hot days of July, things took a darker turn. On August 1, Bui messaged Seymour: \u201c#possiblyruinourfuturesandburnhishousedown.\u201d\nThree evenings later, Siebert and Bui went to Party City to buy black theater masks, then grabbed dinner at Wendy\u2019s. They met up with Seymour, and at around 1 am on August 5 the three piled into Bui\u2019s Toyota Camry. They stopped at a gas station, where they filled a red fuel canister to the brim. Then they set off for Green Valley Ranch, cruising past downtown and the Broncos stadium and through an industrial area dotted with smokestacks and semitrailers. The drive took at least 30 minutes, long and boring enough for any one of the teens to express doubt, postpone, chicken out. But it seemed none of them did, not even when they got to 5312 Truckee and saw a minivan\u2014a family vehicle\u2014parked out front.\nGreen Valley Ranch, in the eastern suburbs of Denver, was a new and sparsely populated neighborhood with a confusing road layout and rows of cookie-cutter family homes. Even longtime city residents found it confusing to navigate.\nPhotography: Jimena Peck\nThey found the house\u2019s back door unlocked. It\u2019s not clear who doused the gas on the living room walls and floors or who set the flame. When it caught, all three stumbled out to Bui\u2019s car and took off.\nWhen Detective Baker\narrived at 5312 Truckee Street two hours later, neighbors swarmed the street, their faces lit by the glow of the flames. The air tasted like ash. He spotted Ernest Sandoval, his partner on the case. Sandoval, nearly 15 years younger than Baker, had moved to homicide from the nonfatal shootings unit only a few weeks earlier.\nThe officers on the scene told the pair that there could be as many as five fatalities. They suspected faulty wiring had sparked the blaze. It was terrible, tragic\u2014but at least homicide\u2019s job would be straightforward. \u201cWe\u2019ll have some reports to write,\u201d Baker remembers thinking. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to probably go to the autopsies.\u201d Then a man with melancholy eyes and a faint soul patch approached him. \u201cI have something you should see,\u201d he said. Noe Reza Jr. lived next door. He took out his phone, which held footage from his security cameras.\nThe video clips started at 2:26 am. They showed three figures in hoodies and masks stealing through the side yard of 5312 Truckee. One points toward the rear of the house. Then they move out of the camera\u2019s sight. Twelve minutes later, the trio sprint back toward the street. At 2:40, flames erupt from the home\u2019s lower floor. Someone screams. The fire consumes the entire house within two minutes.\n\u201cOh, are you kidding me,\u201d Baker thought. Five people had been murdered and their only lead was a few seconds of video that revealed nothing of the criminals\u2019 identity.\nThat morning, Kevin Bui slept in. Around 10 am, he searched online for news of the fire. There was an abundance. The tragedy had sparked headlines and Twitter threads across the world. The Council on American Islamic Relations issued a statement urging police to consider religious hate as a potential motive. Leaders of Colorado\u2019s African community expressed fear, wondering which of their members might be targeted next. Even Senegal\u2019s president tweeted he\u2019d be watching the case closely.\nThat\u2019s when the truth began to dawn on Bui. Like many people, he had assumed that Apple\u2019s Find My device software offers exact location tracking. But such programs rely on an unreliable combination of signals from GPS satellites, cell towers, Wi-Fi networks, and other connected devices nearby, and their accuracy can vary from a few feet to hundreds of miles. In the past, this ambiguity has led to threats, holdups, and even SWAT raids at the wrong addresses. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment.)\nAs he read the news that morning, Bui realized that he had made a terrible mistake. These innocent faces didn\u2019t belong to the guys who had robbed him. He\u2019d killed a family.\nThat August, Denver\u2019s\nusually crystalline skies were choked with wildfire smoke. Baker and Sandoval barely noticed. They spent their waking hours in DPD\u2019s 1970s-era HQ, with its fluorescent lighting and gumball machines in the lobby.\nThe pair had begun their investigation with the usual stuff: interviewing the victims\u2019 friends and family, combing through text messages and financial records. The more they dug, the clearer it became that the families of 5312 Truckee lived quiet, pious lives: work, mosque, home.\nThe detectives returned to video footage. On clips pieced together from nearby Ring cameras, they saw the car the suspects were in taking a series of wrong turns as it entered the neighborhood, and wildly swerving and mounting curbs on the way out. But the videos weren\u2019t clear enough to identify the exact make or model of the dark four-door sedan. The detectives quickly obtained what are known as tower dump warrants, which required the major phone networks to provide the numbers of all cellular devices in the vicinity of 5312 Truckee during the arson. And they slung a series of so-called geofence warrants at Google, asking the company to identify all devices within a defined area just before the fire. (At the time, Google collected and retained location data if someone had an Android device or any Google applications on their cell phone.)\nThe warrants returned thousands of phone numbers, which the detectives dumped on Mark Sonnendecker, an agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) who specialized in digital forensics. Sonnendecker, slim and soft-spoken with a face resembling Bill Nye\u2019s, focused on T-Mobile subscribers. He had noticed that a \u201chigh percentage\u201d of suspects in previous cases subscribed to the network.\nThere were 1,471 devices registered to T-Mobile within a mile of the house when it ignited. Using software that visualizes how long it takes a signal to bounce from a cell tower to a phone and back again, Sonnendecker narrowed the list down to the 100 devices nearest to the house. One evening toward the end of August, detectives roamed the area around 5312 Truckee with a cell-phone-tower simulator that captured the IDs of all devices within range. That night, there were 723. Sonnendecker cross-referenced these with the 100 from earlier, eliminating the 67 that showed up on both lists and likely belonged to neighborhood residents who could be ruled out. That left 33 T-Mobile subscribers whose presence in Green Valley Ranch in the early hours of August 5 couldn\u2019t easily be explained.\nInvestigators considered bringing them in for questioning but decided against it; without any evidence to detain them, they feared spooking the arsonists into fleeing the country. Nothing pointed to any obvious suspects. Still, Sonnendecker remained confident that something would pop up to give police the breakthrough they needed.\nBut as summer turned to fall, progress on the case began to falter. Hundreds of Crime Stoppers tips were still pouring in, including some from psychics. Baker and Sandoval crisscrossed the state to interrogate a trio found with drugs, guns, and masks in Gypsum and to interview the Senegalese community in the mountain town of Silverthorne. (For decades, West Africans had found work in the ski hub\u2019s many resorts, hotels, and grocery stores.) They even chased a lead to Iowa. \u201cWe got pretty hopeful here and there, but it just kind of fizzled out,\u201d recalls Baker.\nThe detectives were feeling the pressure. In the wake of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests that summer, a\npetition\ndemanding police stop \u201cundervaluing the lives of BIPOC individuals\u201d and prioritize the investigation into the deaths of the Diol family collected nearly 25,000 signatures. Baker and Sandoval were told not to take on any new cases so they could work this one full time.\nAt a department\nmeeting in September, Baker and Sandoval pleaded with colleagues for ideas. Was there anything they hadn\u2019t tried\u2014anything at all? That\u2019s when another detective wondered if the perpetrators had Googled the address before heading there. Perhaps Google had a record of that search?\nIt was like a door they\u2019d never noticed suddenly flung open. They called Sonnendecker and the senior deputy district attorney, Cathee Hansen. Neither had heard of Google turning over a list of people who had searched for a specific term. In fact, it had been done: in a 2017 fraud investigation in Minnesota, after a series of bombings in Austin in 2018, in a 2019 trafficking case in Wisconsin, and a theft case in North Carolina the following year. Federal investigators also\nused\na reverse keyword search warrant to investigate an associate of R. Kelly who attempted to intimidate a witness in the musician\u2019s racketeering and sexual exploitation trial. But those records had largely been sealed. So, largely unaware of these precedents, Hansen and Sandoval drafted their warrant from scratch, requesting names, birth dates, and physical addresses for all users who\u2019d searched variations of 5312 Truckee Street in the 15 days before the fire.\nGoogle denied the request. According to court documents, the company uses a staged process when responding to reverse keyword warrants to protect user privacy: First, it provides an anonymized list of matching searches, and if law enforcement concludes that any of those results are relevant, Google will identify the users\u2019 IP addresses if prompted by the warrant to do so. DPD\u2019s warrant had gone too far in asking for protected user information right away, and it took another failed warrant 20 days later and two calls with Google\u2019s outside legal counsel before the detectives came up with language the search giant would accept.\nFinally, the day before Thanksgiving 2020, Sonnendecker received a list of 61 devices and associated IP addresses that had searched for the house in the weeks before the fire. Five of those IP addresses were in Colorado, and three of them had searched for the Truckee Street house multiple times, including for details of its interior. \u201cIt was like the heavens opened up,\u201d says Baker.\nIn early December, DPD served another warrant to Google for those five users\u2019 subscriber information, including their names and email addresses. One turned out to be a relative of the Diols; another belonged to a delivery service. But there was one surname they recognized\u2014a name that also appeared on the list of 33 T-Mobile subscribers they\u2019d identified earlier in the investigation as being in the vicinity of the fire. Bui.\nThe phone was registered to Kevin\u2019s sister Tanya\u2014he may have borrowed it after his was stolen. But a quick scan of the social media accounts of the remaining subscribers on the list yielded three suspects: Kevin Bui, Gavin Seymour, and Dillon Siebert. They were teens, they were friends, and they didn\u2019t live anywhere near Green Valley Ranch. They lived in the Lakewood area, 20 miles away. There was no reason for them to be Googling a residential address so far across town.\n\u201cThere was a lot of high-fiving,\u201d recalls Sandoval. But it was too soon to fully celebrate. They now had to build a case strong enough to prosecute minors in a high-profile homicide. \u201cWe knew this was going to be a big, big, big fight,\u201d Baker says.\nOn New Year\u2019s Day of 2021, Baker drove by the Bui family\u2019s home and snapped a photo of the 2019 Toyota Camry sitting in the driveway. Another warrant to Google yielded the three teens\u2019 search histories since early July. In the days before the fire, Siebert searched for retailer \u201cParty City.\u201d On Party City\u2019s website, Baker spotted masks similar to those worn by the three perpetrators. The company confirmed that their Lakewood location had sold three such masks hours before the fire. Baker then contacted the shopping complex to get footage from the exterior security cameras that night. He saw that around 6 pm, a 2019 Toyota Camry pulled into the parking lot. \u201cIt just snowballed,\u201d says Baker, shaking his head in remembered wonder. \u201cI cannot believe the amount of evidence that we were able to come up with.\u201d\nPhotography: Jimena Peck\nFrom the teens\u2019 texts and social media, detectives were able to see that the morning after the arson, with the house on Truckee Street still smoldering, Bui and Seymour embarked on a camping trip. A week later, Bui went golfing. A few months after that, Seymour joined the Bui family on vacation in Cancun, where more smiling photos of the two emerged, this time on beaches and boats. The posts enraged the detectives. \u201cWhere\u2019s the remorse?\u201d Baker said.\nShortly after 7 am on January 27, police arrested Bui, Seymour, and Siebert. Seymour and Siebert refused to talk, but Bui agreed to an interview and promptly confessed. \u201cHe\u2019d had six months of just keeping this inside,\u201d said Baker. \u201cHe knew that his time had come.\u201d\nFor the next\n18 months, the case dragged through the court system. It took a year for a judge to rule that Siebert, 14 at the time of the crime, would be charged as a juvenile, while 16-year-olds Bui and Seymour would be tried as adults. If convicted, they faced life in prison.\nIn June 2022, just when it seemed like the prosecution could finally proceed, Seymour\u2019s lawyers dropped a bombshell. They filed a motion to suppress all evidence arising from the reverse keyword search warrant that DPD had served to Google\u2014the key piece of information that had led detectives to Bui and his friends.\nNearly two years had passed since the Diols were killed in their own home. Many of the victims\u2019 family and friends still moved through their days fearfully and lay awake nights, reliving the nightmare. Now, the detectives had to tell them that the case might be thrown out altogether, potentially allowing the three teens to walk free.\nSeymour\u2019s defense argued that, in asking Google to comb through billions of users\u2019 private search history, investigators had cast an unconstitutional \u201cdigital dragnet.\u201d It was, they said, the equivalent of police ransacking every home in America. The Fourth Amendment required police to show probable cause for suspecting an individual\nbefore\ngetting a warrant to search their information. In this case, police had no reason to suspect Seymour before seeing the warrant\u2019s results. But the judge sided with law enforcement. He likened the search to looking for a needle in a haystack: \u201cThe fact that the haystack may be big, the fact that the haystack may have a lot of misinformation in it doesn\u2019t mean that a targeted search in that haystack somehow implicates overbreadth,\u201d he said.\nThe teens\u2019 fate looked sealed. Then, in January 2023, Seymour\u2019s lawyers announced that the Colorado Supreme Court had agreed to hear their appeal. It would be the first state supreme court in America to address the constitutionality of a keyword warrant. Though the verdict would apply only in Colorado, it would influence law enforcement\u2019s behavior in other states, and potentially the US Department of Justice\u2019s stance on such warrants too.\nBaker and Sandoval\u2019s investigation had now been dragged into a legal process that could reshape Americans\u2019 right to search and learn online without fear of retribution. \u201cEven a single query can reveal deeply private facts about a person, things they might not share with friends, family, or clergy,\u201d wrote Seymour\u2019s legal team. \u201c\u2018Psychiatrists in Denver;\u2019 \u2018abortion providers near me;\u2019 \u2018is my husband gay;\u2019 \u2018does God exist;\u2019 \u2018bankruptcy;\u2019 \u2018herpes treatment\u2019 \u2026 Search history is a window into what people wonder about\u2014and it is some of the most private data that exists.\u201d\nThe Colorado Supreme Court heard arguments for the case in May 2023. Seymour\u2019s attorney argued that reverse keyword searches were alarmingly similar to geofence warrants, which courts across the country had begun to question. (In August 2024, a federal circuit court of appeals\u2014considered the most influential courts in the United States after the Supreme Court\u2014ruled geofence warrants \u201cunconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment\u201d for never specifying a particular user.)\nDenver\u2019s prosecutor, Cathee Hansen\u2014who\u2019d helped detectives craft the warrant in question nearly three years earlier\u2014compared it to querying a bank for suspicious transactions. \u201cYou don\u2019t go into each person\u2019s account and scroll through their transaction history to see if it applies to that account,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just tap into a database.\u201d Neither search violated any individual\u2019s privacy, she argued.\nThe judges pushed Hansen on the warrant\u2019s applicability to abortion, outlawed in a growing number of states. \u201cI could see warrants coming in from one of those states to Colorado: Who searched for abortion clinics in Colorado?\u201d said Justice Richard Gabriel. \u201cUnder your view, there\u2019d be probable cause for that. That\u2019s a big concern.\u201d\nAfter a five-month wait that Sandoval remembers as \u201cgut-wrenching,\u201d the court finally ruled in October 2023. In a majority verdict, four judges decided the reverse keyword search warrant was legal\u2014potentially opening the door to wider use in Colorado and beyond. The judges argued that the narrow search parameters and the performance of the search by a computer rather than a human minimized any invasion of privacy. But they also agreed the warrant lacked individualized probable cause\u2014the police had no reason to suspect Seymour before they accessed his search history\u2014rendering it \u201cconstitutionally defective.\u201d\nBecause of the ruling\u2019s ambiguity, some agencies remain leery. The ATF\u2019s Denver office says it would only consider using a keyword warrant again if the search terms could be sufficiently narrowed, like in this case: to an address that few would have reason to search and a highly delimited time period. The crime would also have to be serious enough to justify the level of scrutiny that would follow, the ATF says.\nNot everyone is so cautious. Baker and Sandoval regularly field calls from police across the country asking for a copy of their warrant. Baker himself is considering using it in another case. And a cottage industry of consultants that, until recently, helped police craft tower-dump warrants now trains them to requisition Google. No systemic data is being collected on how often reverse keyword warrants are being used, but Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director of digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation says it\u2019s possible that there have been hundreds of examples to date.\nMeanwhile, another case\u2014in which a keyword-search warrant was used to identify a serial rapist\u2014is now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. If the warrant is upheld, as it was in Colorado, their use could accelerate nationwide. \u201cKeyword warrants are dangerous tools tailor-made for political repression,\u201d says Crocker. It\u2019s easy to envision Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requesting a list of everyone who searched \u201cimmigration lawyer\u201d in a given area, for instance.\nBy the summer\nof 2024, all three teens had accepted plea deals: Siebert got 10 years in juvenile detention; Seymour got 40, and Kevin Bui 60, both in adult prison. Bui received the harshest sentence because he\u2019d masterminded the arson. (He was also caught with 92 pills of fentanyl and a couple grams of methamphetamine in his sock while in detention.)\nTo the victims, none of it was enough. Amadou Beye, the husband of Hassan Diol and father of seven-month-old Hawa, addressed Bui directly at his sentencing. \u201cI will never forget or forgive you for what you did to me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou took me away from my wife, the most beautiful thing I had. You took me away from my baby that I will never have a chance to see.\u201d A shudder ran through his tall body. Beye had been in Senegal awaiting a visa when his family was killed. His daughter was born in America, and he never got to meet her.\nBui remained expressionless throughout the victim impact testimonies, save for a furiously bobbing Adam\u2019s apple. Peach fuzz darkened his now 20-year-old jaw. He wore a green jumpsuit, clear-framed glasses, and white shoes. At the end, he read from a crumpled sheet of yellow ruled paper. \u201cI was an ignorant knucklehead blinded by rage. I\u2019m a failure who threw his life away,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no excuses and nobody to blame but myself.\u201d\nBut when I talked to Bui three months later, he sounded upbeat. \u201cWhen you go to prison there\u2019s a lifeline,\u201d he told me. Monday through Friday, he took classes on personal growth and emotional intelligence. Aside from that, \u201cI just work out, I chill with some of the guys. We eat together, watch TV, watch sports,\u201d he said. He tried to catch every Denver Broncos and Baltimore Ravens game. Lately, he\u2019d also gotten into\nSex and the City\n.\nNot once did Bui complain about the lack of privacy in prison or his exile from the outside world, both physical and digital. Prisoners had little internet access, which, for someone of his generation, who\u2019d grown up online, must have been hard. Did he know who he was without his iPhone, his Snapchat and Instagram? Who were any of us really, without our online personas, our memes and TikToks and the access to the entirety of human knowledge afforded by our devices? As Seymour\u2019s lawyers had argued, didn\u2019t our deepest, truest selves reside online, in our searches and browsers?\nAll Bui would say was that he was in a good place now. Then he had to go: He was getting a haircut. Online or not, he still had an image to maintain.\nUpdate: 5/22/2025, 5:20 PM EDT: WIRED has corrected Cathee Hansen's job title, and clarified the extent of law enforcement's prior knowledge of reverse keyword search warrants.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Now mines are powering down, and investors are hoping AI-powered data centers will fill the void.\nFacebook\nX\nEmail\nSave Story\nPhoto-Illustration: WIRED Staff/Getty Images\nSave this story\nSave\nSave this story\nSave\nIf you drive\noutside the city of Campton, population less than 400, the low industrial noise of\ncrypto mining\nrises from the trees. Step closer, and the source comes into view: squat metal buildings that look like shipping containers arrayed in a semicircle, thrumming with fans and processors. There\u2019s chain-link fencing, security cameras, and two guards sitting in pickup trucks just beyond the wire.\nThere are steel shipping containers like this all over these hills, right where the old coal mines once stood. And inside, specialized computers race to solve complex math problems\u2014competing to verify bitcoin transactions and earn slivers of digital currency as a reward.\nFor a brief moment, in 2021, it felt like the region had found its next boom\u2014and it had Bitcoin written all over it. At its peak, Kentucky accounted\nfor some 20 percent\nof the collective computing power dedicated to proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining in the US.\nBut booms, here, have a history. And so do busts. Local officials say it is hard to pin down the exact number of crypto mines still active in eastern Kentucky because state regulations are light and there\u2019s a general lack of transparency in the industry. But what is clear, locals say, is that the boom has begun to recede.\n\u201c\u200aThey'd constructed on someone else's land, or they would be paying a host company to provide the physical plant,\u201d alleges Anna Whites, a lawyer who represented a roster of crypto mining clients. \u201cSo they'd pay the down payment or they would convince the landowner to pay the down payment, and then they would mine the first three months and then they'd go into the next billing set cycle, go almost to the end of it and then disappear.\u201d\nIn early 2022, when Mohawk Energy initiated a crypto mining project in Jenkins, Kentucky, local officials said this time it would be different. Cofounded by Kentucky senator Brandon Smith, Mohawk purchased a sprawling 41,000-square-foot building and the 8 acres around it. It leased most of it to a Chinese crypto mining company, and the rest of the building included classrooms and hands-on training centers that were supposed to teach locals how to repair iPads, maintain Bitcoin rigs, and build skills for a digital economy. It was a big deal for Jenkins. A local PBS station ran a story about the launch. The images showed tool kits, workers, and smiling officials.\n\u201cThe plan with Mohawk was to employ retired coal miners and disabled veterans who were back in eastern Kentucky and couldn\u2019t find work, and train them,\u201d said Whites, who counts Mohawk as one of her clients. Among other things, the project promised near-six-figure salaries and a vow to put some of the mining proceeds into the training program, to help grow it. And for a time, it worked.\nWhites said that for a brief moment\u2014about 18 months\u2014things looked promising. Twenty-eight families saw real gains: One person from each family landed a permanent job, and about 30 more relatives found work nearby. But when we asked where things stood now, she paused. \u201cI believe most of them are unemployed again.\u201d\nThe\nunraveling came quickly.\nThe Chinese partner sued for breach of contract. Mohawk counter-sued. And the shared crypto profits never materialized. Now, as some Kentucky residents have soured on bitcoin mining, they\u2019ve started to speak about AI data centers in the same way they used to talk about coal seams and hash rates: with a kind of cautious hope. AI, they say, could bring jobs, fiber optics, and permanence.\nColby Kirk runs a nonprofit called One East Kentucky, focused on bringing economic development to the region. He remembers the moment the conversation shifted, back in April when he was in Paducah for the Kentucky Association for Economic Development\u2019s spring conference.\n\u201cThey had some site selection consultants that were on the panel, and they were talking about data centers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd they talked about this I-81 corridor up through Pennsylvania where there\u2019s all kinds of these big data centers. And they talked about whether our communities could prepare for some of these kinds of investments? And the consultant was like, here\u2019s kind of what it takes.\u201d\nWhat it takes, it turns out, is no small feat: flat land, lots of power, fiber connectivity, and a workforce that can wire and weld. As fate would have it, the number of welders in the area, according to regional economic development organization One East Kentucky, is about\ntwice the national average\n, which stands to reason, because wherever there\u2019s metal and stress\u2014and there\u2019s a lot of both in coal mines\u2014welders are the people who keep it all from falling apart.\nThe old infrastructure is still there too; substations, hardened ground, cooling systems, and power-hungry hardware just waiting to be switched back on. \u201cMaybe a data center or something is a part of the puzzle,\u201d Kirk said.\nSo, at the conference, when the panel ended and the floor opened to questions, Kirk says he asked the one he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about.\n\u201cYou know, 50, 60 years ago it would take a room bigger than my office to power a computer, and now I've got a computer I carry around in my pocket that's more advanced than what we sent astronauts to the moon with,\u201d he recalls asking. \u201cAre these data centers going to keep taking up million-square-feet buildings with 30- and 40-foot ceilings, or are we gonna be left with an abundance of warehouse or industrial-scale buildings that we won't be able to keep up?\u201d\nThe consultant, he claims, didn\u2019t have a good answer. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Kirk says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to hold when it comes to this stuff.\u201d\nThat kind of ambiguity doesn\u2019t sit well with Nina McCoy. She\u2019s a former high school biology teacher from Inez, a coal town made famous in 1964 when President Lyndon Johnson used it to generate support for his War on Poverty.\n\u201cThis is going to sound awful,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if they're putting it here, then that means it's bad. We've lived here long enough to see that that is how it works. You put those things that you don't want in your neighborhood in a place like this.\u201d\nHer skepticism is rooted in lived experience: In October 2000, a massive coal slurry spill from a mine site upstream poisoned the Coldwater Fork stream, which runs behind her house. People in Inez couldn\u2019t drink water from the tap for months.\n\u201cThose of us living downstream didn't hear about it for a while, but the school system had to close down for about a week until they got an alternate water source,\u201d she says.\nTo this day, many in Inez still don\u2019t trust the tap water.\nSo when McCoy hears the hype about AI, she hears something else: another promise that comes with a cost. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed these people to be called job creators,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s AI or crypto or whatever, we bow down to them and let them tell us what they are going to do to our community because they are job creators. They\u2019re not job creators, they\u2019re profit makers.\u201d\nAnd the profit leaves a footprint.\nAI data centers demand staggering amounts of energy\n\u2014a ChatGPT search uses up to 10 times more energy than a regular Google one\u2014and they run hot. To keep them cool, these facilities consume billions of gallons of water every year. Most of that evaporates, but residents are wary because they have had problems with facilities and their runoff in the past, so they worry these new facilities could affect fish and disrupt the land. The very things the residents of Kentucky hope to preserve.\nStill, some locals see potential, even progress.\n\u201cAI is in everything that we do,\u201d said Wes Hamilton, a local entrepreneur who did his fair share of crypto mining in Kentucky in its heyday. \u201cSiri, ChatGPT, robotics\u2014everything you can imagine has to have AI,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin is a one-trick pony. You create it. The only person that gets paid is the owner of the machines.\u201d\nHamilton claims there is a path forward where data centers bring in investors, engineers, maybe even companies willing to stay. All the AI people in the world would be steaming into Kentucky, Hamilton says. And while he admits to losing a fortune in crypto ventures in the past, he claims this is different.\nWhen Bitcoin first arrived, lawmakers offered generous tax breaks to lure miners. Companies investing more than $1 million were exempted from paying sales taxes on hardware and electricity. And then, in March 2025, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear took all that and went a step further by signing a \u201cBitcoin Rights\u201d bill into law.\nThe legislation, cast as a defense of personal financial freedom, is designed to enshrine the right to use digital assets in Kentucky. An earlier draft went further, aiming to bar local governments from using zoning laws to restrict crypto mining operations\u2014a provision that drew resistance from environmental groups. That language was eventually tempered, but the intent remains: to signal that, in Kentucky, digital extraction can keep humming.\nWhich is why we found ourselves outside this facility in Campton, staring at this semicircle of metal buildings nestled in the trees. The mines run all night and all day, even Sundays. And the question some are asking now, with bitcoin hovering around $100,000 and\nbig miners talking about pivoting to AI\n, is whether bitcoin mining gets a second wind in Kentucky.\nMohawk\u2019s bitcoin mining may even make a comeback. Anna Whites said the parties are supposed to go into arbitration May 12th. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful,\u201d she told us. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that they sit down and say, \u2018Mighty nice plant you have there. Let\u2019s just go ahead and turn it on.\u2019\u201d\nYou Might Also Like \u2026\nIn your inbox:\nUpgrade your life with\nWIRED-tested gear\n\u201cWi-Fi keeps going down\u201d\n: Trump\u2019s RTO mandate is going terribly\nBig Story:\nThe worm that\nno computer scientist can crack\nYuval Noah Harari\n: \u201cPrepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence\u201d\nUncanny Valley:\nAn insider look at\nthe influence of Silicon Valley\nDina Temple-Raston\n, a former NPR correspondent, is a freelance journalist and the host and managing editor of the twice-weekly tech news podcast\nClick Here\nfrom PRX and Recorded Future News. ...\nRead more\nFreelance Writer\nTopics\nbitcoin\ncryptocurrency\nartificial intelligence\nmining\nRead More\nOpenAI Backs Down on Restructuring Amid Pushback\nThe startup behind ChatGPT is going to remain in nonprofit control, but it still needs regulatory approval.\nParesh Dave\nThese Startups Are Building Advanced AI Models Without Data Centers\nA new crowd-trained way to develop LLMs over the internet could shake up the AI industry with a giant 100 billion-parameter model later this year.\nWill Knight\nNorth Korea Stole Your Job\nFor years, North Korea has been secretly placing young IT workers inside Western companies.

You'll have to login to the account you signed up with for your hackathon to download the extension.\nNote: you can choose which MCP tools to expose to the agent, and in fact define your own agents as MCP tool calls (eg, @mcp_tool github_agent(instruction: str)), and you can internally chain together the tool calls already built out to interface with the user's browser.\nOn mac, use command-J to activate Dex.\nFrom author\nThere might be a couple of bugs so would appreciate feedback / reports so I can put out some hotfixes as we go :)\nHotfixes:\nAdded logging to chrome extension and browser to see the LLM's full response & tool results\nAdded ability to refresh MCP server on browser\nAdded tool to send LLM message to user\nUpdate instructions:\ngo to chrome://extensions/\ntoggle developer mode\nupdate, should be 2.60\nOverview\nThis MCP server provides browser automation capabilities including tab management, navigation, DOM interaction, and visual

Claude 4 Opus will be immediately available to paying Claude subscribers, while Claude Sonnet 4 will be available to free and paid users.\nThe new models, which jump the naming convention from 3.7 straight to 4, have a number of strengths, including their ability to reason, plan, and remember the context of conversations over extended periods of time, the company says. Claude 4 Opus is also even better at playing Pok\u00e9mon than its predecessor.\n\u201cIt was able to work agentically on Pok\u00e9mon for 24 hours,\u201d says Anthropic\u2019s chief product officer Mike Krieger in an interview with WIRED. Previously, the longest the model could play was just 45 minutes, a company spokesperson added.\nA few months ago, Anthropic launched a Twitch stream called \u201cClaude Plays Pok\u00e9mon\u201d which showcases Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u2019s abilities at Pok\u00e9mon Red live. The demo is meant to show how Claude is able to analyze the game and make decisions step by step, with minimal direction.\nCourtesy of Anthropic\nThe lead behind the Pok\u00e9mon research is David Hershey, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic. In an interview with WIRED, Hershey says he chose Pok\u00e9mon Red because it\u2019s \u201ca simple playground,\u201d meaning the game is turn-based and doesn\u2019t require real-time reactions, which Anthropic\u2019s current models struggle with. It was also the first video game he ever played, on the original Game Boy, after getting it for Christmas in 1997. \u201cIt has a pretty special place in my heart,\u201d Hershey says.\nHershey\u2019s overarching goal with this research was to study how Claude could be used as an agent\u2014working independently to do complex tasks on behalf of a user. While it's unclear what prior knowledge Claude has about Pok\u00e9mon from its training data, its system prompt is minimal by design: You are Claude, you\u2019re playing Pok\u00e9mon, here are the tools you have, and you can press buttons on the screen.\n\u201cOver time, I have been going through and deleting all of the Pok\u00e9mon-specific stuff I can, just because I think it\u2019s really interesting to see how much the model can figure out on its own,\u201d Hershey says, adding that he hopes to build a game that Claude has never seen before in order to truly test its limits.\nWhen Claude 3.7 Sonnet played the game, it ran into some challenges: It spent \u201c\ndozens of hours\n\u201d stuck in one city and had trouble identifying nonplayer characters, which drastically stunted its progress in the game. With Claude 4 Opus, Hershey noticed an improvement in Claude\u2019s long-term memory and planning capabilities when he watched it navigate a complex Pok\u00e9mon quest. After realizing it needed a certain power to move forward, the AI spent two days improving its skills before continuing to play. Hershey believes that kind of multistep reasoning, with no immediate feedback, shows a new level of coherence, meaning the model has a better ability stay on track.\n\u201cThis is one of my favorite ways to get to know a model. Like, this is how I understand what its strengths are, what its weaknesses are,\u201d Hershey says. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of just coming to grips with this new model that we're about to put out, and how to work with it.\u201d\nEveryone Wants an Agent\nAnthropic\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon research is a novel approach to tackling a preexisting problem\u2014how do we understand what decisions an AI is making when approaching complex tasks, and nudge it in the right direction?\nThe answer to that question is integral to advancing the industry's much-hyped AI agents\u2014AI that can tackle complex tasks with relative independence. In Pok\u00e9mon, it\u2019s important that the model doesn\u2019t lose context or \u201cforget\u201d the task at hand. That also applies to AI agents asked to automate a workflow\u2014even one that takes hundreds of hours.\n\u201cAs a task goes from being a five-minute task to a 30-minute task, you can see the model\u2019s ability to keep coherent, to remember all of the things it needs to accomplish [the task] successfully get worse over time,\u201d Hershey says.\nAnthropic,\nlike many other AI labs\n, is hoping to create powerful agents to sell as a product for consumers. Krieger says that Anthropic\u2019s \u201ctop objective\u201d this year is Claude \u201cdoing hours of work for you.\u201d\n\"This model is now delivering on it\u2014we saw one of our early-access customers have the model go off for seven hours and do a big refactor,\u201d Krieger says, referring to the process of restructuring a large amount of code, often to make it more efficient and organized.\nThis is the future that companies like Google and OpenAI are working toward. Earlier this week, Google released Mariner,\nan AI agent built into Chrome\nthat can do tasks like buy groceries (for $249.99 per month). OpenAI recently\nreleased a coding agent\n, and a few months back\nit launched Operator\n, an agent that can browse the web on a user\u2019s behalf.\nCompared to its competitors, Anthropic is often seen as the more cautious mover, going fast on research but slower on deployment. And with powerful AI, that\u2019s likely a positive: There\u2019s a lot that could go wrong with an agent that has access to sensitive information like a user\u2019s inbox or bank logins. In a blog post on Thursday, Anthropic says, \u201cWe\u2019ve significantly reduced behavior where the models use shortcuts or loopholes to complete tasks.\u201d The company also says that both Claude 4 Opus and Claude Sonnet 4 are 65 percent less likely to engage in this behavior, known as reward hacking, than prior models\u2014at least on certain coding tasks.\nAnthropic\u2019s chief scientist, Jared Kaplan, tells WIRED that Claude 4 Opus is the company\u2019s first model to be classified as ASL-3\u2014a\nsafety level\nthat the company uses to evaluate a model\u2019s risks.\n\u201cASL-3 refers to systems that substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse compared to non-AI baselines,\u201d the company\nsaid\nin a blog post outlining the policy.\nKaplan says the frontier red team, the safety group in charge of stress-testing Anthropic\u2019s models for vulnerabilities, conducted extensive evaluations on Claude 4 Opus and developed new measures to mitigate disastrous risks. In a statement provided by the company, a spokesperson said Sonnet 4 is being released under ASL-2, the baseline safety classification for all of Anthropic\u2019s models. The larger model, Opus 4, is being treated more cautiously under stricter ASL-3 rules unless more testing shows that it can be reclassified as ASL-2.\nThe goal is to build AI that can handle increasingly complex, long-term tasks safely and reliably, Kaplan says, adding that the field is moving fast, past simple chatbots and toward AI that acts as a \u201cvirtual collaborator.\u201d It\u2019s not there yet, and the key challenge for every AI lab is improving reliability long-term. \u201cIt's useless if halfway through it makes an error and kind of goes off the rails,\u201d Kaplan says.\nUpdate 5/22/25 1:35 ET: This story has been updated to include new details about the availability of Claude 4 Opus and Claude Sonnet 4.\nYou Might Also Like \u2026\nIn your inbox:\nUpgrade your life with\nWIRED-tested gear\n\u201cWi-Fi keeps going down\u201d\n: Trump\u2019s RTO mandate is going terribly\nBig Story:\nThe worm that\nno computer scientist can crack\nYuval Noah Harari\n: \u201cPrepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence\u201d\nUncanny Valley:\nAn insider look at\nthe influence of Silicon Valley\nKylie Robison\nis a senior correspondent at WIRED covering the business of artificial intelligence.

That demand from\nAI\n, the research states, could double by the end of this year, comprising nearly half of all total data-center\nelectricity\nconsumption worldwide, excluding the electricity used for\nbitcoin\nmining.\nThe new research is published in a commentary by Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company that evaluates the environmental impact of technology. De Vries-Gao started Digiconomist in the late 2010s to explore the impact of bitcoin mining, another extremely energy-intensive activity, would have on the environment. Looking at AI, he says, has grown more urgent over the past few years because of the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and other large language models that use massive amounts of energy. According to his research, worldwide AI energy demand is now set to surpass demand from bitcoin mining by the end of this year.\n\u201cThe money that bitcoin miners had to get to where they are today is peanuts compared to the money that\nGoogle\nand\nMicrosoft\nand all these big tech companies are pouring in [to AI],\u201d he says. \u201cThis is just escalating a lot faster, and it\u2019s a much bigger threat.\u201d\nThe development of AI is already having an impact on Big Tech\u2019s climate goals. Tech giants have\nacknowledged in recent sustainability reports\nthat AI is largely responsible for driving up their energy use. Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, have increased 48 percent since 2019, complicating the company\u2019s goals of reaching net zero by 2030.\n\u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute,\u201d Google\u2019s 2024 sustainability report\nreads\n.\nLast month, the International Energy Agency released a\nreport\nfinding that data centers made up 1.5 percent of global energy use in 2024\u2014around 415 terrawatt-hours, a little less than the yearly energy demand of Saudi Arabia. This number is only set to get bigger: Data centers\u2019 electricity consumption has grown four times faster than overall consumption in recent years, while the amount of investment in data centers has nearly doubled since 2022, driven largely by massive expansions to account for new AI capacity. Overall, the IEA predicted that data center electricity consumption will grow to more than 900 TWh by the end of the decade.\nBut there\u2019s still a lot of unknowns about the share that AI, specifically, takes up in that current configuration of electricity use by data centers. Data centers power a variety of services\u2014like hosting cloud services and providing online infrastructure\u2014that aren\u2019t necessarily linked to the energy-intensive activities of AI. Tech companies, meanwhile, largely keep the energy expenditure of their software and hardware private.\nSome attempts to quantify AI\u2019s energy consumption have started from the user side: calculating the amount of electricity that goes into a single ChatGPT search, for instance. De Vries-Gao decided to look, instead, at the supply chain, starting from the production side to get a more global picture.\nThe high computing demands of AI, De Vries-Gao says, creates a natural \u201cbottleneck\u201d in the current global supply chain around AI hardware, particularly around the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the undisputed leader in producing key hardware that can handle these needs. Companies like Nvidia outsource the production of their chips to TSMC, which also produces chips for other companies like Google and AMD. (Both TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment for this article.)\nDe Vries-Gao used analyst estimates, earnings call transcripts, and device details to put together an approximate estimate of TSMC\u2019s production capacity. He then looked at publicly available electricity consumption profiles of AI hardware and estimates on utilization rates of that hardware\u2014which can vary based on what it\u2019s being used for\u2014to arrive at a rough figure of just how much of global data-center demand is taken up by AI. De Vries-Gao calculates that without increased production, AI will consume up to 82 terrawatt-hours of electricity this year\u2014roughly around the same as the annual electricity consumption of a country like Switzerland. If production capacity for AI hardware doubles this year, as analysts have projected it will, demand could increase at a similar rate, representing almost half of all data center demand by the end of the year.\nDespite the amount of publicly available information used in the paper, a lot of what De Vries-Gao is doing is peering into a black box: We simply don\u2019t know certain factors that affect AI\u2019s energy consumption, like the utilization rates of every piece of AI hardware in the world or what machine learning activities they\u2019re being used for, let alone how the industry might develop in the future.\nSasha Luccioni, an AI and energy researcher and the climate lead at open-source machine-learning platform Hugging Face, cautioned about leaning too hard on some of the conclusions of the new paper, given the amount of unknowns at play. Luccioni, who was not involved in this research,\nsays\nthat when it comes to truly calculating AI\u2019s energy use, disclosure from tech giants is crucial.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because we don\u2019t have the information that [researchers] have to do this,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why the error bar is so huge.\u201d\nAnd tech companies\ndo\nkeep this information. In 2022, Google published a paper on machine learning and electricity use,\nnoting\nthat machine learning was \u201c10%\u201315% of Google\u2019s total energy use\u201d from 2019 to 2021, and predicted that with best practices, \u201cby 2030 total carbon emissions from training will reduce.\u201d However, since that paper\u2014which was released before Google Gemini\u2019s debut in 2023\u2014Google has not provided any more detailed information about how much electricity ML uses. (Google declined to comment for this story.)\n\u201cYou really have to deep-dive into the semiconductor supply chain to be able to make any sensible statement about the energy demand of AI,\u201d De Vries-Gao says. \u201cIf these big tech companies were just publishing the same information that Google was publishing three years ago, we would have a pretty good indicator\u201d of AI\u2019s energy use.\nYou Might Also Like \u2026\nIn your inbox:\nUpgrade your life with\nWIRED-tested gear\n\u201cWi-Fi keeps going down\u201d\n: Trump\u2019s RTO mandate is going terribly\nBig Story:\nThe worm that\nno computer scientist can crack\nYuval Noah Harari\n: \u201cPrepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence\u201d\nUncanny Valley:\nAn insider look at\nthe influence of Silicon Valley\nMolly Taft\nis a senior writer for WIRED, covering climate change, energy, and the environment.

Amodei, wearing a light-gray jacket and a pair of Brooks running shoes, replied without skipping a beat: \u201c2026.\u201d (Later in the press lounge, a spokesperson said they dub this version of Amodei \u201cprofessor panda\u201d due to his casual-professional attire and his love for pandas\u2014his Slack profile picture is him with a stuffed panda.\nPhotograph: Don Feria/AP Images\nThere\u2019s a common company line you\u2019ll hear about agents, and Krieger got to it quickly: They won\u2019t replace employees, just help human workers with tasks. \u201cThey're moving from just being engineers to being managers of several autonomous agents, tackling everything from a simple coding task to complex, full-stack development projects across multiple code bases,\u201d Krieger said. \u201cIt took our technical onboarding time to get engineers up to speed from two to three weeks to two to three days.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a belief echoed by Anthropic\u2019s top brass. Cofounder Jack Clark\nhas said\nhe expects people to \u201cmanage fleets of AI agents,\u201d while Amodei says he\nbelieves\nsoftware engineers are necessary (for now) to guide models. Still, as the models get more capable in areas from coding to creative writing, it certainly seems like redundancies are imminent.\n\u201cI think we're just at the beginning of what we can do with the new generation of model in terms of tasks,\u201d Amodei said, noting that he\u2019s particularly excited about Opus\u2019 ability to aid in cybersecurity and biomedical research.\nAnthropic is making a big push into biomedical research,\noffering up to $20,000 in API credits\nto researchers in biology and genetics. \u201cWe have found that the [new] model\u2019s abilities in biology are substantially better,\u201d Amodei said in a press briefing. This has contributed to Claude Opus 4\u2019s Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear risk level, making it the highest risk model Anthropic has released to date\nbased on its Responsible Scaling Policy\n.\nAnthropic CPO Mike Krieger\nPhotograph: Don Feria/AP Images\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei\nPhotograph: Don Feria/AP Images\nAfter the morning keynote, journalists were ushered from the dark auditorium to a sunny deck upstairs, and I went to scavenge for snacks and doodads\u2014I got a handful of Anthropic magnets and a tote bag that says \u201cCode w/ Claude.\u201d After an hour of media gossip and diet cokes, we headed back down for a press briefing with Amodei (who skipped into his chair) and Krieger.\nIn March, Amodei had\nsaid\nthat \u201c90 percent of code\u201d will be written by AI within the next six months. So I was curious to ask both executives how much of Anthropic's code is currently written by Claude.\n\u201cSomething like over 70 percent of [Anthropic\u2019s] pull requests are now Claude code written,\u201d Krieger told me. As for what those engineers are doing with the extra time, Krieger said they\u2019re orchestrating the Claude codebase and, of course, attending meetings. \u201cIt really becomes apparent how much else is in the software engineering role,\u201d he noted.\nThe pair fiddled with Voss water bottles and answered an array of questions from the press about an upcoming\ncompute cluster with Amazon\n(Amodei says \u201cparts of that cluster are already being used for research,\u201d) and the displacement of workers due to AI (\u201cI don't think you can offload your company strategy to something like that,\u201d Krieger said).\nWe\u2019d been told by spokespeople that we weren\u2019t allowed to ask questions about policy and regulation, but Amodei offered some unprompted insight into his views on a controversial provision in President Trump\u2019s megabill that would ban state-level AI regulation for 10 years: \u201cIf you're driving the car, it's one thing to say \u2018we don't have to drive with the steering wheel now.\u2019 It's another thing to say \u2018we're going to rip out the steering wheel, and we can't put it back in for 10 years,\u2019\u201d Amodei said.\nWhat does Amodei think about the most? He says the race to the bottom, where safety measures are cut in order to compete in the AI race.\n\u201cThe absolute puzzle of running Anthropic is that we somehow have to find a way to do both,\u201d Amodei said, meaning the company has to compete and deploy AI safely. \u201cYou might have heard this stereotype that, \u2018Oh, the companies that are the safest, they take the longest to do the safety testing. They're the slowest.\u2019 That is not what we found at all.\u201d\nPhotograph: Don Feria/AP Images\nPhotograph: Don Feria/AP Images\nPhotograph: Don Feria/AP Images\nAfter an array of journalist-exclusive fireside chats with Anthropic\u2019s top researchers, including researcher and philosopher Amanda Askell, cofounder Chris Olah, and researcher Jan Leike, attendees poured out of the event center into Waymos and Ubers or waited around for the after-party.\nWhat I heard from\nKrieger on Wednesday\n, and from a spokesperson at the conference, is that the company decided to throw this conference now because it\u2019s finally a big enough company to host one.\nThe company has doubled in size in the past year to 1,300 employees and is valued at a whopping $61.5 billion. For a company that once positioned itself as the careful cousin in a reckless industry, Anthropic seems ready to step into the spotlight\u2014and eager to host the party.\nYou Might Also Like \u2026\nIn your inbox:\nUpgrade your life with\nWIRED-tested gear\n\u201cWi-Fi keeps going down\u201d\n: Trump\u2019s RTO mandate is going terribly\nBig Story:\nThe worm that\nno computer scientist can crack\nYuval Noah Harari\n: \u201cPrepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence\u201d\nUncanny Valley:\nAn insider look at\nthe influence of Silicon Valley\nKylie Robison\nis a senior correspondent at WIRED covering the business of artificial intelligence.

Think again.\nEmployees at the San Diego Humane Society are wearing bear costumes to tend to a cub that came into the organization's care last month. The reason they're dressing the part? To make sure the baby black bear doesn't bond too much with the humans raising it before they try to return the animal to the wild.\nThe two-month-old black bear cub is the youngest the organization has ever cared for,\nit said in a statement\n. It's the fourth bear this young in five years to enter rehabilitation care in California.\nA human caretaker dressed as a bear feeds a black bear cub at the San Diego Humane Society, in Ramona, Calif..\nSan Diego Humane Society\nCampers in the Los Padres National Forest found the cub, weak, underweight and alone, on April 12, the humane society said. After failed attempts to reunite the cub with its mother in the wild, California Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists dropped the bear off April 14 at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center.\n\"Our team stepped in to give him the second chance he deserved,\"\nthe humane society said on Instagram\n.\nMore than 30 days into its stay, the cub is stable, playful and thriving, the humane society said.\nA human caretaker dressed as a bear cares for a black bear cub at the San Diego Humane Society, in Ramona, Calif..\nSan Diego Humane Society\n\"He was extremely fragile when he arrived,\" said Autumn Welch, Wildlife Operations Manager at the Ramona Wildlife Center. \"After going several days without nutrition, it was touch-and-go at first. But now, he's active, eating well and gaining weight steadily.\"\nThe group plans on watching after the cub for up to a year, to prepare it to return to the wild once it's old and strong enough.\nThe organization said the state wildlife agency would try to pair the animal with another cub should one end up in state care, calling this \"a critical strategy to keep orphaned cubs wild and reduce the risk of imprinting on humans.\"\nThe other strategy the organization is employing to ensure the little bear doesn't bond too much with his human caretakers: having its team wear bear suits \"to mimic maternal behaviors,\" it said on Instagram.\nThe bear cub gets four enrichment and feeding sessions a day that will help to prepare it for life in the wild, the humane society said, noting the \"extraordinary amount of time, expertise and resources\" it takes to raise a bear from this young age. Welch also said it's rare to see cubs this young without their mothers.\nVideo shared on the organization's Instagram shows the bear climbing on a makeshift jungle gym in its enclosure and humane society workers playing with it with a stuffed bear toy.\nRebecca Cohen\nRebecca Cohen is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\nAbout\nContact\nHelp\nCareers\nAd Choices\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Privacy Choices\nCA Notice\nTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)\nNBC News Sitemap\nClosed Captioning\nAdvertise\nSelect Shopping\n\u00a9\u00a02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\nNBC News Logo\nMSNBC Logo\nToday Logo"

The decision means Boeing won\u2019t face trial as scheduled next month, as crash victims\u2019 family members have urged for years.\nThe Department of Justice met with crash victims\u2019 family members last week to discuss the potential deal.\nBoeing 737 MAX airplanes parked on the tarmac at the Boeing Factory in Renton, Wash., on March 21, 2019.\nLindsey Wasson / Reuters file\nIn a court filing Friday the DOJ said it \u201cis the Government\u2019s judgment that the Agreement is a fair and just resolution that serves the public interest.\u201d\nThe agreement \u201cguarantees further accountability and substantial benefits from Boeing immediately, while avoiding the uncertainty and litigation risk presented by proceeding to trial.\u201d\nThe DOJ said it intends to file a motion to dismiss the case once the \u201cagreement in principle\u201d is finalized, by no later than the end of next week.\nUnder the agreement, Boeing will have to \u201cpay or invest\u201d more than $1.1 billion, the DOJ said in its filing in federal court in Texas on Friday. That amount includes a $487.2 million criminal fine, though $243.6 million it already paid in an earlier agreement would be credited. It also includes $444.5 million for a new fund for crash victims, and $445 million more on compliance, safety and quality programs.\nBoeing declined to comment.\nThe company has been trying for years to put the two crashes of its best-selling Max planes \u2014 a\nLion Air flight\nin October 2018 and an\nEthiopian Airlines flight\nless than five months later \u2014 behind it. The Maxes were\ngrounded\nworldwide for nearly two years after the second crash, a pause that gave rival Airbus a head start in recovering from the Covid pandemic.\nBut families of the crash victims have criticized previous agreements as sweetheart deals for Boeing, called for more accountability from the company and said its executives should stand trial. In 2022, a former chief technical pilot for Boeing was\nacquitted\non fraud charges tied to the Max\u2019s development.\nSeveral of the victims\u2019 family members issued a statement through their lawyer shortly after the court filing was released criticizing the deal and saying it set a troubling precedent for other large companies.\n\u201cThis kind of non-prosecution deal is unprecedented and obviously wrong for the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history. My families will object and hope to convince the court to reject it,\u201d said the families\u2019 lawyer, Paul Cassell.\nThe Justice Department said relatives of more than 110 crash victims told the government they support the non-prosecution agreement or \u201csupport the Department\u2019s efforts to resolve the case pre-trial more generally,\u201d but added that others said they want the U.S. to take Boeing to trial and that they would litigate to dismiss the deal.\nThe aerospace giant reached a\nsettlement\nin 2021 in the\nfinal days\nof the first Trump administration that shielded it from prosecution for three years.\nUnder that deal, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.51 billion fine to avoid prosecution. That included a $243.6 million criminal penalty, a $500 million fund for crash victims\u2019 family members and $1.77 billion for its airline customers. The new fund will be on top of the $500 million that was already established.\nThat 2021 settlement was set to expire two days after a\ndoor panel\nblew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9 operated by\nAlaska Airlines\non Jan. 5, 2024, after the aircraft left Boeing\u2019s factory without key bolts installed.\nBut last year, U.S. prosecutors said Boeing violated the 2021 settlement, accusing the company of failing to set up and enforce a compliance and ethics program to detect violations of U.S. fraud laws.\nLast July, toward the end of the Biden administration, Boeing\nagreed to plead guilty\nto the criminal fraud charge in a new settlement. A federal judge later rejected the plea deal, citing\nconcerns\nwith diversity, equity and inclusion requirements for choosing a corporate monitor.\nUnder that 2024 deal, Boeing would have faced a fine of up to $487.2 million, though the Justice Department recommended that the court credit Boeing with half that amount it paid under the previous agreement.\nThe U.S. had accused Boeing of conspiracy to defraud the government by\nmisleading regulators\nabout its inclusion of a flight-control system on the Max that was later implicated in the two\ncrashes\n.\n\u201cBoeing\u2019s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception,\u201d then-acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division said at the time of the 2021 deferred prosecution agreement.\nMessages revealed in an investigation into the Max\u2019s development showed the former top Boeing pilot who was found not guilty of fraud in 2022, Mark Forkner, told the FAA to delete the flight-control system known as MCAS from manuals and, in a separate email, he boasted about \u201cjedi-mind tricking\u201d regulators into approving the training material.\nLawyers for victims\u2019 family members railed against last year\u2019s preliminary plea deal, equating it to a slap on the wrist for the corporate giant, which recently won a\ncontract\nworth billions to build the next-generation fighter jet and works on other military programs including outfitting two new\npresidential jets\n.\nMore from CNBC:\nHow big EU tariff could backfire on Trump, according to trade, freight experts\nApril home sales dropped to the slowest pace for that month since 2009\nWhy Trump\u2019s iPhone tariff threat might not be enough to bring production to the U.S.\nLeslie Josephs, CNBC\nAbout\nContact\nHelp\nCareers\nAd Choices\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Privacy Choices\nCA Notice\nTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)\nNBC News Sitemap\nClosed Captioning\nAdvertise\nSelect Shopping\n\u00a9\u00a02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\nNBC News Logo\nMSNBC Logo\nToday Logo"
